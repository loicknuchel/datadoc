# DataDoc

DataDoc is an app to help document hive data.

It's very early development and this repo is here to show event sourcing design and get feedback.

For more details, you can look at [mockups](http://loicknuchel.fr/datadoc/) and [specifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N6S4iC2Fg70EAlwQrhLSr4PO5EgnynJpt3gZ9Ldjat4/edit?usp=sharing) (that you can comment to help improve the design ^^)
